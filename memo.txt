spawn user not behaving as expected, keeps saying user doesnt exist in database, even when i am the message author.
reminder.edit_event_text and .create_event both working

edited async_db.user_exists to fix user.spawn_user, did not test whether bug resolved.
edit event functions all complete and working on test
